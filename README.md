## Introduction:
The purpose of this report is to analyze ratings of common Mexican restaurants using a publicly available dataset. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into customer satisfaction, restaurant performance, and possible areas for improvement. The dataset includes information or restaurant ratings in Mexico by real consumers from 2012, including additional information such as restaurant names, locations, consumer ratings, each restaurant and their cuisines, and each consumer and their preferences. 

Understanding how customers rate Mexican restaurants can provide valuable insight into what factors contribute to higher satisfaction and how restaurants can adapt their services to meet customer expectations more effectively.

## Analysis:
### Data Overview
The dataset contains the following key variables:
- Restaurant Name

### Distribution of Ratings
•	The majority of restaurants have ratings between 3.5 and 4.5.
•	Very few establishments are rated below 3.0, indicating generally favorable customer satisfaction.
•	Restaurants rated above 4.5 often had high review counts and premium service offerings.

### Impact of Number of Reviews
•	There is a positive correlation between the number of reviews and the rating score for restaurants rated highly (above 4.2), suggesting popular establishments tend to maintain good quality.
•	Some low-rated restaurants also had many reviews, which could indicate consistent quality issues or controversial service experiences.

### Geographic Trends

•	Suburban and rural areas had more variability in ratings, possibly due to less competition or lower foot traffic.
